        <p class="lead">Business IP transactions help customers make best use of their IP and check whether their existing IP has been put to best use. This is the business part of the IP. How should our IP be used? How should it be asserted? Is someone using it? What value is our IP at? What all IP we have and how do they stand? What are the best IPs and the not so best ones? These are tough questions for an IP holder and probably the most important ones too. We answer them.</p>
        
        <p class="lead">Having an IP is just like having an investment. If the investment is not yielding any returns, probably it is not being handled in the correct manner. We help our clients and take over their painful queries and provide them with answers and ways to keep their IP under check.</p>
