        <p class="lead">Licensing these days is in a direction wherein all inventors who get their patents granted want to license their patents. Thereby, making a pool of patents available for licensing is the trend. However, many of these are either not useable or not useful. We at PRISM IP therefore, want to reverse the trend.</p>
        <p class="lead">We take up requests of our clients who require certain technological helps that can, in one way, be solved by existing patents. Therefore, we aggregate requests for technological solutions and identify the best available options for our clients. Hence, we make ends meet through an opposite approach that is time effective and of course useful for the clients.</p>
